          Click Room is a web-based application that we created to help students, lecturers, and staff in borrowing rooms on campus. 
          The creation of this application is motivated by the fact that there is often a miss of communication in borrowing rooms on campus. 
          Often one room is borrowed by two parties simultaneously, which should not happen. One room can only be borrowed by one party for 
          certain reasons so that the activities that take place in the room can run effectively. Fatal consequences if this continues to happen.
